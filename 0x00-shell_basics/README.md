Directory names should end with a slash (/)

Files and directories starting with a dot (.) should be listed

The listing should be alpha ordered, except for the directories . and .. which should be listed at the very beginning

Only digits and letters are used to sort; Digits should come first

You can assume that all the files we will test with will have at least one letter or one digit

The listing should end with a new line.
